= Using the Robot Framework Maven Plugin with Selenium Library =

_*Note: Only available starting version 1.1. Please see Note below*_

Starting version 1.1, a _extraTestLibraries_ parameter has been added to the plugin. You can use this to add extra test libraries to your build. 

By default, you should add them to _${project.basedir}/src/test/resources/robot/libraries_



== Configuration and Installation ==

Download the tarball from the Selenium Library [http://code.google.com/p/robotframework-seleniumlibrary/downloads/list download page], e.g. robotframework-seleniumlibrary-2.6.tar.gz

Extract the file and move the _SeleniumLibrary_ directory from _robotframework-seleniumLibrary/src_ to _${project.basedir}/src/test/resources/robotframework/libraries_.

So your project will have _yourProject/src/test/resources/robotframework/libraries/SeleniumLibrary_

Now, you can use Selenium Library Keywords to your tests. 

e.g.

{{{
*** Settings ***
Library  SeleniumLibrary
Suite Set Up  Start Selenium Server
Suite Tear Down  Stop Selenium Server


*** Test Cases ***
My Test
   Open Browser  http://robotframework.googlecode.com
}}}
