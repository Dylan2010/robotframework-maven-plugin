= Using the Robot Framework Maven Plugin with Selenium Library =

_*Note: Only available starting version 1.1. Please see Note below*_

Starting version 1.1, a _extraTestLibraries_ parameter has been added to the plugin. You can use this to add extra test libraries to your build. 

By default, you should add them to _${project.basedir}/src/test/resources/robot/libraries_



== Configuration and Installation ==

Download the tarball from the Selenium Library [http://code.google.com/p/robotframework-seleniumlibrary/downloads/list download page], e.g. robotframework-seleniumlibrary-2.6.tar.gz

Extract the file and move the _SeleniumLibrary_ directory from _robotframework-seleniumLibrary/src_ to _${project.basedir}/src/test/resources/robot/libraries_.

So your project will have _yourProject/src/test/resources/robot/libraries/SeleniumLibrary_

Now, you can use Selenium Library Keywords to your tests. 

e.g.

{{{
*** Settings ***
Library  SeleniumLibrary
Suite Set Up  Start Selenium Server
Suite Tear Down  Stop Selenium Server


*** Test Cases ***
My Test
   Open Browser  http://google.com
}}}


== Note ==
No formal 1.1 Release yet, so please use the snapshot version:

Add the following to your pom:
{{{
    <pluginRepository>
      <id>robotframework-maven-plugin-snapshots</id>
      <url>http://robotframework-maven-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/maven/snapshots</url>
      <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
      </snapshots>
    </pluginRepository>
}}}
This would enable you to grab the snapshot artifact.

Starting with 1.1, _jybot_ goal is no longer available. You should now use _run_:
{{{
            <goals> 
              <goal>run</goal>
            </goals>
}}}
Also take note that by this version, the default directory of where your test cases should reside is already at: _${project.basedir}/src/test/resources/robot/tests_
