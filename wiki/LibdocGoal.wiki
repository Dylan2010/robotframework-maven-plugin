= Libdoc Goal =

Runs the "libdoc" command to generate documentation of user libraries.
This script can generate keyword documentation in HTML and XML formats. The former is suitable for humans and the latter for RIDE, RFDoc, and other tools. This script can also upload XML documentation to RFDoc system.

Documentation can be created for both test libraries and resource files. All library and resource file types are supported, and also earlier generated documentation in XML format can be used as input.

== Usage ==

You can invoke {{{mvn robotframework:libdoc -DlibraryOrResourceDirectory=src/main/java/com/example/keywords}}} to generate documentation for user libraries contained in that package. The documentation, by default, goes to _${project.build.directory}/robot_.
