= Jybot Goal =

Runs the "jybot" command.

Robot Framework test cases are created in files and directories, and they are executed by configuring the path to the file or directory in question to the _testCasesDirectory_ configuration. The given file or directory creates the top-level test suite, which gets its name, unless overridden with the "name" option, from the file or directory name.


== Usage ==

By default, test cases located at _${project.basedir}/src/test/resources/robot_ gets run during the _integration-test_ phase. 

If for example you want to run test cases in a different path, say _${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/robot_, configure your pom as so:

{{{
      <plugin>
        <groupId>com.googlecode</groupId>
        <artifactId>robotframework-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.0</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>jybot</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
        <configuration>
          <testCasesDirectory>${project.basedir}/src/main/resources</testCasesDirectory>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
}}}

Generated reports are written to _${project.build.directory}/robot_ by default. This could be overridden by configuring the _outputDirectory_ configuration.
